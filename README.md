This is multiplayer party game that utilizes a host device that displays the game. On any screen that has acess to an internet browser. On that host screen will be a QR code, up to four players can that code.
once scanned your phone will turn into a controller with a joy-stick and a fire button. This is a prototype, but so no game assest yet. Enjoy!
